# Files

- **CodeBook.md** A narrative document that describes the variables, data, and processing performed to clean the data.

- **run_analysis.R** This file is an R Script file that performs data preparation and the 5 steps described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
-1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.<br/>
-2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.<br/>
-3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. <br/>
-4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.<br/>
-5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

- **FinalData.txt** is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
